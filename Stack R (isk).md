**Project Goal:**
Our research project focuses on analyzing data from the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). The dataset includes information about developers, their preferences, and usage patterns. We aim to explore correlations and relationships between various variables, with a particular focus on programming languages.

**Data Description:**
The dataset contains information on whether a person used a specific programming language this year and whether they want to use it next year. We have identified the following key variables for analysis:

1. **Correlation between using R and wanting to use Python next year:**
   - Hypothesis: There is a positive correlation between not wanting to use R and wanting to use Python next year, among those using R.

2. **Correlation between wanting to use R next year and wanting to use Python next year:**
   - Hypothesis: There is a negative correlation between wanting to use R and wanting to use Python next year.

3. **Linear correlation between age and wanting to continue using R:**
   - Hypothesis: There is a positive linear correlation between age and the desire to continue using R among those who currently use R.

**Preliminary Insights:**
- Most of the responses we'll be testing come from the US and Germany - we'll need to be careful with applying this data to our immediate surroundings.
- 4% of respondents have used R while only 3% of professional developers have used it.
- 5% of those learning to code have used R this year, which might mean our prediction about age and desire is incorrect - it requires further investigation.
- 49% of respondents have used python this year.
- With 89k responses overall, there is plenty of data to conduct our research.
- Only 39% of those using R want to continue using it, while it's 66% for python - we'll have to take this initial skew into account and compare everything to the general population.
